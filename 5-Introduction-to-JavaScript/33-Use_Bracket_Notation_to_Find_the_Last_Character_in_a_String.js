/* Bracket notation can be used with .length to index to the last
element of the string. Because indexing begins at 0, the last element of a
string is located at index .length - 1  */

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var lastLetterOfFirstName = firstName[firstName.length - 1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 1];
